# Predicting-Heart-Disease-with-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical and demographic patient data. By analyzing key features such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and chest pain type, the model aims to assist in early diagnosis, enabling faster intervention and improved patient care.

🔍 Project Overview

1) Dataset: This dataset was from Kaggle. Contains multiple health indicators like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.

2) Goal: Predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

3) Tools Used: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and classification model - Logistic Regression.

💡 Why This Project Matters

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death globally. Early and accurate detection is crucial. This project demonstrates how machine learning can support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients through data-driven insights.


🔧 Potential Extensions

1) Integrate SHAP or LIME for model explainability.

2) Deploy the best-performing model into a simple web app for hospital or clinic use.

3) Expand the dataset to include more recent and diverse patient profiles.

4) Perform hyperparameter tuning for even greater model optimization.
